# FFRK Team Planner
## Excel VBA project to plan and calculate team setups for Final Fantasy Record Keeper game.
Idea is that this spreadsheet can be used as database for finding information about game items, abilities, characters ets. And also player can select characters for party, equip them and save as party setup for later use (this was made prior to game update where saving setups to favourites list was implemented). And also player can get some damage and healing numbers for his setups.

Unfortunately last working version is lost.
